# Pyckaxe

a simple Python script demonstrating how Tmux can be used to create "vanilla plugins" in Minecraft. 

Not recommended for production use yet.

***This is just a proof of concept/dumb hack currently. If there is interest + help I might turn it into a real project***

## Requirements:

OS: Anything with tmux. Tested on Linux; verified to work on Debian and Arch. Should work on most if not all others with tmux.
Software: tmux, Python 3.4+
Python Modules: requests, libtmux, nbt

aGPLv3.0 license (meaning network access is distribution)
