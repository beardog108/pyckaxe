# Pyckaxe

a simple Python script demonstrating how Tmux can be used to create "vanilla plugins" in Minecraft. 

Not recommended for production use yet.

***This is just a proof of concept/dumb hack currently. If there is interest + help I might turn it into a real project***

## Requirements:

- OS: Anything with tmux. Tested on Linux; verified to work on Debian and Arch. Should work on most if not all others with tmux.

- Software: tmux, Python 3.4+

- Python Modules: requests, libtmux, nbt (install these with pip)

In addition, you need to get a copy of the official Minecraft server jar. Name it mc.jar and put it into the same directory as Pyckaxe. I cannot distribute the jar file due to legal reasons.

This software is under an aGPLv3.0 license (meaning network access is distribution)
